Spent some good time brushing up on some python to prep for some scripting that I'll need to do. Also worked on getting a web framework ready for the front end design.

### Day 02:
#### 2020-06-28: Sunday
I spent some time looking into automation scripts for my email account. I'm a bit of a digital pack rat. Well I'm a bit of a pack rat in meat-space too. I found some 5 inch floppy disks while sorting out some totes earlier in the day. De-cluttering my life is one of my recent goals both in the physical and digital spaces. This has already helped my mental focus and I'm looking forward to continuing to order my environments. 

While I have some mail filters set up to automatically sort and categorize incoming mail, the one thing that I can't do natively in Gmail is to delete messages in a given category after a period of time. For example:
- Any sort of newsletter email goes into my "forums" tab and gets a label based on the sender. Most of these are weekly or 1-2 times a month. I want to keep these around until I read them, but after a while (say 2 months) I'm probably not going to get to them so I want to keep the most recent 2 months. 
- I don't like physical mail, so if an email option exists, I take advantage of it. I thus get receipts for online orders, bank statements, utility bills, etc all sent to my email. I'd like to keep these for reference, but I probably don't need to have my power bill from 10 years ago. Setting the threshold to delete anything after 18 months. 
- Personal correspondence or letters I'll want to keep or export to some other medium and manually determine importance. Anything labeled here will not be auto-deleted. 

Gmail allows custom scrips so I started looking into the interface and language it uses.

### Day 01:
#### 2020-06-27: Saturday
Spent most of the day working on some CSS stylings to create a custom design for a friend's Dungeons and Dragons campaign. Much of the ones I've seen are based off of print layout so I wanted to make something that adapted to both tablet and mobile and various screen resolutions. 

I spent some time doing mockup plans for a phone layout that looks promising. The desktop version is still very similar to a print layout. Still trying to decide if what I want to do there. 

I don't have some of the art assets yet. Those will come in this week. I'll plan on doing some layout design for those at this point. I've included links to some of the mockup ideas for mobile. The colours are for contrast and not the end design before you think I've got color blind. :)

###### *meh 40 days is close enough to 100 right?*
## Introduction

Coding is the magic of our day. Taking tasks that used to take countless hours by hand and pressing the "run" button only to have the program fail and spend more hours fixing the program than it would have taken to do by hand in the first place. So yeah, like magic. Long hours of study. Speaking obscure languages. Dressing in clothes of questionable fashion taste? Yep sounds like wizard mischief to me. 

Aside from goofy paragraph writing, I've been on a coding kick this year, and I noticed that I have 40 days left in summer before I take my pre-fall-semester vacation. While not a 100 days of coding, 40 days of coding can still provide me with some of that social pressure to stick to a routine. My goal here is two fold. First to get some good headway on some projects that I've been kicking around for a while now. Second, to get in the habit of spending time studying/working each day that I can transition to using for school work come fall term. 

How does this work? 
- I will be spending an hour a day working on some sort of programming/coding work. 
- The next day, 5 mins before I start, I will update what I did the previous day. 
  - This will also help me figure out where I left off (although that would never happen, right?) and jump right back in. 
  - I'll put these updates on my github which will also contain any cool programs I make that are worth sharing. 
- The will run from June 27 through Aug 6th.

Most updates will be much shorter than this intro post so no need to fear anymore weird metaphors. 
With that, let's get started.
